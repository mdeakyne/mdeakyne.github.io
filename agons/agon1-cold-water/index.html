<h2><em>Expose yourself to cold water (for at least a 5-minute stretch) every day for 7 days.</em></h2>
<h3>Experience</h3>
<p>
I started off with cold shower in Kansas on Saturday through Wednesday.  On Thursday, I travelled to Colorado - which introduced a new level of cold shower. On Friday, I bathed in a Colorado river, which left me cold to my bones hours afterward.  
</p>
<h3>Takeaways</h3>
<p>
This was much more of a mental challenge than anything.  It was physically challenging, but each day I needed to chose to overcome the little voice in the back of my head telling me that this isn't worth it.  That little voice stops me from doing many of the other things I try.  This challenge helped me realize that I can overcome the voice, and once I start something it gets easier to keep going.  Every day I faced that voice, and every day I overcame and got cold.  This is applicable to many other goals - but especially to things like this website.  Each day I will improve, and either clean up code or add content.
